This plugin adds a simple settings dialog to allow you to add extra snippets of CSS that will be included in the OctoPrint UI.

After saving your changes, you will need to refresh your browser window to have the changes reflected.

Currently there is no syntax highlighting, but that is planned to be added in the future.
